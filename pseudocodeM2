             user is given chance to hit until bust or hold, afterwards dealer hits until it beats user
             or busts.

Add packages to randomize
create list representing the hands
dictionary representing the deck and points
// going to need some point handling system for cards (dictionary?)
// need to keep track of bets wins and losses
